Using fMRI and multivariate pattern analyses during naturalistic scene viewing,
we find that feedback about object information is only present during an object
task and is directed to foveal V1. Conversely, feedback about scene information
is directed to V1 as a whole regardless of task.

These results therefore constitute an advance to the field of neuroscience by
extending our knowledge about the models that our brains construct to
efficiently represent and predict the world.

Moreover, they link a behavioral measure to these internal models, which play
an active role in many components of human behavior, including visual
predictions, action planning, and decision making.
