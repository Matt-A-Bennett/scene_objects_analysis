Using fMRI and multivariate pattern analyses during naturalistic scene viewing,
we find that feedback about object information is only present during an object
task and is directed to foveal V1. Conversely, feedback about scene information
is directed to V1 as a whole regardless of task. The results demonstrate that
feedback signals can be liberated from the retinotopic coordinate system and
allow V1 to act as a cognitive active blackboard. We propose that V1 be
seen as a proactive and functionally flexible extension of the higher areas.
