We find that fMRI activity patterns corresponding to occluded visual
information in early visual cortex fill in scene-specific features. Line
drawings of the missing scene information correlate with our recorded activity
patterns, and thus to internal models. Despite our extensive knowledge of the
sensory features that drive cortical neurons, we have a limited grasp on the
structure of our brains' internal models. These results therefore constitute an
advance to the field of neuroscience by extending our knowledge about the
models that our brains construct to efficiently represent and predict the
world. Moreover, they link a behavioral measure to these internal models, which
play an active role in many components of human behavior, including visual
predictions, action planning, and decision making.
